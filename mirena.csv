Mirena IUD,NA,"April 1, 2009",10,0,"		“I have had my IUD for over a year now and I think it's the best thing ever. When I first got it put in I only bled for about a week with a little cramping. After that nothing at all. I haven't had a period for about 8months until I finally got one, and its not bad at all. It's light, no cramping, no headache, nothing. I haven't gained weight, my acne is gone, and my moods are fine. I know all women are different, but I just hear all these horror stories and I just wanted to tell my story, which is a good one. Hope it calms some of your fears.”",1546
lisalor1,NA,"December 21, 2020",9,0,"		“I wanted to come back here and write a review because before I got the Mirena I was reading all of these, although aware that people are more inclined to write about their horror stories rather than their happy stories. 

So here is my happy story!

I was using the ring for a couple years before I tried Mirena. The ring made me miserable, hormonal, moody, irregular. I was very depressed from the fluctuating hormones.

In comes Mirena. The Mirena has been the best choice I have ever made for myself. It is true what all my friends and reviewers say. I do not feel hormonal or moody. In fact I feel much more balanced! My skin does break out at times but I will happily take that over what I was experiencing before. My periods have stopped and I sometimes pms about a week before what WOULD be my period, but it is very mild and manageable. Sooo happy with my Mirena!!! I was scared just like you and it was the best choice I made for myself.”",189
Anonymous,NA,"May 7, 2010",1,0,"		“I have had this for about 5 months now.. I had NO IDEA others were going through the same things I am... I am tired, moody and have gained about 25 lbs.. I have been working out more and couldn't figure out what was going on until now. I am dry during sex, not in the mood most of the time. Acne has been pretty bad, didn't know why that was either (don't usually have acne). For a few weeks now my body feels like it is pregnant. The moods, tired, etc.... but all tests say not pregnant. It makes me uncomfortable to have so many things going on.”",552
CoffeeCatz,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 15, 2021",10,0,"		“Hi sisters. This is my review only of the insertion, as I just had the Mirena put in 2 hours ago. Before the appointment, I took the recommended Motrin, Ativan (to calm my nerves) and the medication that softens your cervix, which my gyno was kind enough to prescribe for me to hopefully make the insertion process smoother.  The entire process took no more than 5 minutes. It felt like a slightly longer pap exam, with more pressure than usual. I didn’t cramp, I didn’t yelp in pain, and I didn’t pass out or feel sick. What got me through my anxiety was taking deep breaths. It was not excruciating as I expected it to be, since I have never given birth (I’m 40, btw). Here’s hoping this device works for me and agrees with my body. I had been on the pill for over 20 years, and I look forward to not having to take them every day.  I’ll report back in a few months with an update. Good luck to all of you ladies. Do what is best for you.”",77
Anonymous,NA,"October 1, 2008",10,0,"		“I love my Mirena. I've recommended it to several friends. I'm 43 and have 2 kids and wanted something to simplify my life. Insertion was not at all painful or even uncomfortable. I had some spoting continuously for about 3 weeks, but since then I haven't had my period (2 years). I have no side effects at all, and I love NOT getting my period. No cramping, mood swings, PMS, heavy bleeding, not to mention all the dollars saved on NOT buying outrageously expensive tampons and pads.

I have never been so happy with a product of this nature. Much better than the pill and that awful sponge, messy diaphragm and horrid condoms!”",556
OB Nurse,NA,"October 22, 2009",NA,0,"		“I am an OB nurse, married with two children ages six and three. I chose the Mirena after suffering severe migraines on the pill. I interviewed several OB doctors at my job and my pregnant patients about their form of birth control prior to their pregnancy and decided to give the Mirena a try.I had the Mirena inserted in early May. Insertion process was very painful.It reminded me much of mild labor contractions. After the insertion, I had mild cramps for the remainder of the day.  For three weeks thereafter, I experience light spotting and wore a pantyliner. For the next four months, I would spot beginning the same day each month for a week followed by a regular light period two weeks after the spotting subsided. It is now five months after insertion and I did spot for less time but no period came. Rather, I experience symptoms of bloating and increased appetite as if my period is going to start but without the period. I am most happy to  report NO migraines and I lost weight! My mood and libido has remained the same. I cannot feel the string I was instructed to check for monthly, and no complaints from my husband. I did experience some hair loss and noticed my complexion is not as clear, but overall, I am satisfied with the Mirena and recommend woman to try it especially if you want a low maintenance birth control method.”",468
Justjessica,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"October 3, 2020",1,0,"		“I have issues with hormones any time I have been pregnant or been on birth control I get every bad side effect possible. I was hopeful for this one. I had it in for a month and had severe  headaches, cystic acne (literally all over my face &amp; no wash would make it go away) constantly felt light headed/dizzy, nauseous, zero sex drive, horrible mood swings, my period lasted 12 days and I was constantly bleeding, horrible stomach pains randomly when I moved certain ways.  This medication made my anxiety &amp; depression worse. So bad that I couldn’t be around my 4 year old son because I’d get so anxious if have a panic attack. One day at three weeks of having it in I had such a bad panic attack over literally nothing I had to lay down in a dark room with a fan on me, got so worked up I passed out. Do your research there are a lot of harmful things that can happen when being on the Mirena IUD that they don’t tell you at the doctor. Do your research!!!”",86
Shell,NA,"June 6, 2020",1,0,"		“I got the Mirena IUD placed 7 weeks after my second son was born. I heard good things about it from the girls I worked with. They told me they loved it. Placement was pretty painful, even though I just have birth 7 weeks Prior to it. I bled constantly for 2 in a half months  After that the bleeding only happened when my monthly flow was coming. When it  came it was pretty heavy and would last 7-8 days. My periods were right on schedule monthly . Then I started feeling fatigue, anxiety, massive mood swings, depression, insomnia.  I had to push myself to get out of bed and take care of my children. Around month 9 I started getting blurred vision. I had blurred vision when I was on the pill after my first child was born. I knew it was the IUD causing all this. I had it removed 2 days ago. Spotted a little after removal. But now have a full on heavy flow. My mood has changed  a lot already. I’m calmer like I used to be. Not 100% back to myself yet, but removing it was the best thing I did.”",94

I got the Mirena last year and the only side effect I had was hair loss but I'm not quite sure if it was the Mirena or from just having another baby. But other than that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I have been reading all these reviews and they were almost all negative I was wondering if something was wrong with me. Since I got the Mirena last year I lost weight, no more cramps, lightened periods, and a better sex drive (probably because I don't have to worry if I'm going to get pregnant), I feel safe. So would I recommend the Mirena, YES.”",430
Mama2929,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 25, 2019",9,0,"		“I had the Mirena placed three months ago. The insertion was painful, I won’t fabricate that, but it only lasted at most 12 seconds and it was over. I took both Tylenol and Advil before my appointment and that seemed to help a bit. The more uncomfortable/painful cramping lasted less than 24 hours after my appointment. I took the day off of work which I am glad I did. 
The first 2/3 weeks after I had it placed I had no bleeding or spotting. 
I had medium spotting for 2 months on and off after, I just usually wore a liner. Bleeding lasted a few days and would be inconsistent. 
The third month the spotting was extremely light and would occur 1-2x per week. My hormones seem to be actually really well balanced. I experienced some  neck acne for the first 2 months but that did subside. 
I haven’t gained or lost any weight. My sex drive is unchanged. 
I’ve read plenty of horror stories on the internet in regards to this method, so I thought I would throw in a positive one.”",82
S,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"June 26, 2020",1,0,"		“The Mirena seemed like a great option for me as I had negative experiences with other forms of birth control. Insertion was fine but I had severe cramping for a few days after. My moods were up and down for the first few months and I wanted to have it removed but my doctor recommended to try it for 6 months. It has now been 6 months and my mental health is the worst it has ever been. I'm constantly on the verge of tears and cannot cope with everyday life. I have a history of anxiety but I've never felt this low. I would not recommend the Mirena if you are sensitive to other birth controls (pill, implanon). I still have bad cramps on the Mirena and my periods are heavier. Can't wait to have it removed!”",66
JM,NA,"August 20, 2020",NA,0,"		“I have had the Mirena in for for nearly 2 years. Was ok for first few months odd cramp here and there. 6 months after insertion got my first (of many) bacterial infections. Cramps, pain during sex, brown smelly discharge. Always cleared up with flagyl and cream. I can’t even count how many I have had since then. It’s awful. I have 0 sex drive which makes my partner and me feel awful. Every time I get spotting always puts fear in me that it could be something more sinister which always escalates my anxiety. Have made an appointment to get it removed, as I can't live like this anymore.”",61
delainegirl,NA,"August 9, 2009",2,0,"		“I'm 27 years old and the mother of two boys. I had the Mirena inserted one and a half years ago. The insertion was fine, mild cramping, but for the last year and a half I have experienced depression, bad acne, weight gain of about ten kilos, mood swings. Six months ago once my periods stopped altogether the symptoms got worse. I began having stomach cramps, nausea on most days, painful breasts and diminished libido and when it was supposed to be that time of the month my abdomen would bloat. I had Mirena removed last week and feel like a new person. I'm already losing weight and all the other symptoms have vanished.”",278
Callie,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"August 24, 2020",6,0,"		“I am a nurse practitioner working in women's health, so I thought I knew what to expect when I had my Mirena placed 3 months ago. I was WRONG! I have had bleeding every single day since insertion - occasionally just spotting but most days I have light-to-moderate bleeding like the final couple days of a period. I do not have cramps, and I have had an ultrasound to ensure proper device placement. I know that irregular bleeding is common in the first few months of use, but I did not expect the bleeding to be this persistent or this heavy. I am going to give it a few more months to see if the bleeding resolves; if it does not, I may have to get the Mirena removed.”",55
Anonymous,NA,"September 24, 2010",10,0,"		“First off, I was 25 and childless.  I had tried the pill, but I am a poor forgetful soul, and that was unacceptable. The patch left an icky mark that hurt my skin.  I am married so we are beyond condoms.  My Mirena insertion, a year and a half ago, was somewhat painful, so I took a nap.  I had some cramps for the first two weeks, probably due to getting used to the hormones in the IUS.  My first cycle afterward, the blood seemed thin and only lasted a few days.  I have not had a period since. I really like Mirena because it's easy and I don't have to think about it. My sex drive is still great, and I don't have to pay every month for birth control.  I just wanted to explain all of the side effects I experienced so others could be informed.”",250
Mommy of a 3 month old!,NA,"September 12, 2008",9,0,"		“I love my Mirena. I had it inserted 4 weeks after my son was born. unfortunately I had to deliver him C section and he was my first child, so my cervix never dilated thus, the insertion of my Mirena was painful. For a couple weeks after I bled pretty heavily (but that could've been from his birth as well), and the bleeding stopped after about 4 weeks. I have not had a period (not even any spotting or cramping) yet and I am SUPER happy with that. I had horrible periods before. No side effects, weight gain, acne, etc, thus far (12 weeks later) despite the pain of insertion, I would do it 100 more times for the benefits. I would recommend Mirena to anyone.”",258
proBC,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"August 14, 2019",10,0,"		“Just wanted to share my experience because I think it is really important to add that more often than not people post negative reviews rather than positive because they find it more necessary. Nothing wrong with that, it's just the reason I am posting my review. Please if you are considering birth control talk with your health care provider about what is best for your individual need.

Anyways, I got the Mirena about 2 and a half years ago and I have NEVER looked back. I recommend it to all of my girlfriends. Yes there is some discomfort upon insertion but I haven't had my period in 2 and a half years! The amount of money and time and honestly just stress and emotions that I've saved make up for it ten-fold. I also did not gain weight, didn't get acne, and just overall have forgotten I've even had it. No period and no unwanted pregnancy with no side effects, I really couldn't think of a better scenario. I highly recommend if it's something you've been considering.”",72
JoMel,Taken for 10 years or more,"August 26, 2020",10,0,"		“Had Mirena twice after my son was born in 2007 (one for 5yrs and the other one was past due and was removed after 8yrs) never got pregnant even after the 5 year mark (don't recommend though). During Mirena I had absolutely no issues. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. No period on site, never got pregnant. 
June 4th 2020 I decided to have Mirena removed because I was ready to have another baby. Doctor advised for me to wait until first full menstrual period to conceive, but I did not wait. Oops. :) they say should take 6 months to a 1 year to get pregnant after Mirena removal but turns out today is Aug 25th and I am now 10 weeks pregnant. I am 35yrs old (that delicate age) and  I can say that I am a truly believer of this contraceptive. It is true; might not be for everyone but it sure did work for me. 100% recommend.”",45

Other than some slight cramping during and some moderately worse cramping later that day and for a few days after (nothing pain killers can't handle) it's been great!  I used to have really heavy, really painful periods (which is why I went with Mirena over the paraguard) and though I was supposed to get my period the week after they put it in I haven't had anything but super light, almost non-existent spotting.”",241
Liv,NA,"October 5, 2019",1,0,"		“I had my Mirena inserted in March 2017, because my husband &amp; I didn’t want anymore kids. The insertion wasn’t bad, it didn’t bother me. I had irregular bleeding for about 2 months, then no more periods. I had a healthy sex drive, that crumbled with Mirena. I thought it was unrelated to the Mirena, my Dr said it couldn’t be the Mirena. I couldn’t lose weight &amp; always felt bloated. My skin was constantly breaking out with acne. My husband &amp; I agreed for him to get a vasectomy. I had the Mirena taken out in August 2019. I didn’t even feel him take it out. A) I started to lose weight &amp; that constant bloated feeling B) My sex drive is back to what it used to be, I felt broken for over 2 years C) My skin is clear D) I have energy &amp; lost that feeling of depression &amp; fatigue. Listen to your body, everyone is different, my Dr tried to convince me to keep it in, but I choose what was best for me. Some women love it, some hate it, this is my personal experience with Mirena.”",63
rainrain,NA,"December 7, 2009",8,0,"		“It's now been three months since I had the Mirena IUD inserted and I'm glad I went for it. The insertion was not painful, although measuring the cervix was. However, the pain went away real quick. I had lots of cramping and spotting for the first six weeks, and since I'm very sensitive, it made me a bit moody too. However, as it settles in, I'm loving the convenience and the no-worry assurance of birth control, and I'm very glad I got the Mirena.  Read a lot of negative reviews before I went for my appointment, but I felt like it was the right thing for me and I'm glad I trusted my instincts. 
If you're thinking of getting one, just know that there is an initial adjustment period and things will get better if you just give it some time.”",209
HSF,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 20, 2015",9,0,"		“I was scared to get Mirena after reading all the horror stories but got it anyways and I'm liking it so far! I'm 20 years old with no kids. Cramping during insertion and off and on for a few days after, nothing unbearable. Skin has gotten better and I've actually lost weight but this might not have anything to do with Mirena. Only downside is I'm still spotting but my doctor said it should be gone within a month or so. No pain during sex and my boyfriend says he can't feel the strings either. Would definitely recommend! Don't let all the horror stories scare you.”",128
Sherry,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"December 15, 2020",3,0,"		“Soon after I had Mirena inserted I began getting migraines and episodes of dizziness. I stuck it out since I was relieved to finally not have incredibly painful, heavy periods. Aside from developing some cystic acne and those occasional migraines/dizzy episodes things were going relatively okay. 9 months later I started to develop panic attacks and extreme anxiety. I have a dull headache every day. I am dizzy nearly all of the time, I have developed some facial hair and my hair is falling out of my scalp. I have insomnia. This is incredibly frustrating to me as my GP keeps writing it off as ""general anxiety"". I did not have these issues before Mirena. I was perviously incredibly active, adventurous and enjoyed cycling, jogging, hiking. Now I am afraid to do anything because of how dizzy I am and the intense anxiety I now experience. I just hope once I have this removed I can return to my normal self. I haven't felt like ""me"" in nearly a year and it is getting really tough.”",32

I started a diet program two weeks after insertion, and I have lost 21 lbs in the last 6 weeks, so don't believe it when people tell you that they gained a whole bunch of weight after insertion.

I have to say that I was pretty nervous after reading so many bad comments. I was on the 3rd day of my period and for me the insertion hurt like a couple of pinches and a really bad cramp that gave me all hot and made me nauseous. But it only took about 10 minutes and then it was okay. The rest of the day I had fairly strong cramps but nothing unbearable. The next day I felt back to normal. My period lasted another couple of days and stopped like normal. Since then I have had very minor spotting with an odd little cramp here and there. Very happy so far.”",177

It is 2 days since I got it in and I'm sore and yes it was really crampy but I just wanted to say: Don't over read like I did on the internet. Everyone's cervix and uterus is different, everyone has different pain levels. My pain tolerance is high (I've had spine procedures while awake), I've had wicked period cramps and my NP said my ""perfect cervix"" made the insertion extremely smooth. With all that said.. did it hurt? Kinda. Was it uncomfortable? Yup. Was it PAINFUL? No. I'm sore, but I've barely bled which is another plus and I think a week from now I will be even more happy that I got it done! My point is - don't over read. People tend to only post negative experiences online, but this is something that is already stressful enough. I don't think it's right to scare women before they get it done ( and no, I've never had children).”",46

Right now, I have gained 10lbs, loss of sex drive, have headaches, back pain, insomnia, constipation, hair loss and general depression - OF COURSE that's going to cause to have mood swings.

donkitat,NA,"March 13, 2010",9,0,"		“I've had it for 6 days. I don't have kids, am young compared to most users, and have a tilted uterus.

It hurt but only for about 20 seconds. I had a kind of reverse contractions for 2 hours. I was directed to take 800mg of ibuprofen. I suggest going #2 before the insertion, since it's very painful to do so after. Since insertion I've had minor spotting, and very little pain. Do not use a tampon, it's so painful to remove.

Danielle23,NA,"February 24, 2014",9,0,"		“Alright ladies, my experience with Mirena entails no gruesome or terrifying stories that will make you run for the hills. My experience with Mirena has been fairly good.  I got Mirena approximately 6 months ago. Beforehand I was entirely frightened due to the horrible reviews that people post on the internet. But let me just straighten this out. Some people do have bad experiences but those people are the ones who feel obligated to narrate their story to the world.  So I'll be the one to write something positive.  Slight pain during the insertion, nothing worse than cramps.  A month of irregular bleeding. Only to be followed by four months of glorious period free time.  I occasionally get spotting but it isn't anything bad at all.”",89
KANash,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"December 19, 2019",1,0,"		“I had the Mirena taken out after a year. I wish I would have never got an IUD and I wouldn't advise anyone to do so. It's been a month since I had it taken out and still do not feel normal. My main side effect  is/was extreme fatigue and vision issues. My hair has started to fall out, my back hurts all the time. I also have had pelvic pain that feels like contractions from labor. I have seen multiple doctors about my fatigue and they all make me feel like I'm making this up because all my labs and tests come back normal. They try to say maybe it's just anxiety. :( So I'm praying in a couple more weeks to months I feel completely back to normal. It's sad to think an IUD can cause symptoms like this and make you feel like something is BAD wrong with your body. Hope this helps anyone suffering with the same symptoms.”",33

Very effective, easy, worry free method of protection! My menstrual cycles were barely a cycle, and I was so happy to feel the freedom of no heavy bleeding or clotting!

Yesterday , I had the Mirena removed. Again just a little pinch, and mild cramping. Ahhhhhh my body was saying thankful because immediately I felt better!  Today, I am down 9 pounds! YES that’s the honest truth, 9 pounds gone!!!!! :) I’m so thankful I listened to my body, noticed the changes and made the decision to remove it! I feel so much better!   I encourage all to research before making a decision. Most importantly, listen to your body! If you don’t feel right, somethings off, go see your Dr!  Best wishes to all for a happy, healthy body! :)”",32
Ave225,NA,"July 3, 2019",10,0,"		“After reading the reviews, I was terrified. Then I got to thinking, most of the time people only volunteer to share their reviews if they have had a negative experience. I am on a weight loss journey so I was scared I would gain weight on the Mirena, and also even after having the paragard 2 times I was scared to have the Mirena inserted after reading reviews. Monday I went in to get the Mirena, my doctor reassured me that less than 5% of women gain weight and that most of the time the weight gain is caused from other factors. The procedure itself was quick. There is a small amount of pressure as the IUD is inserted but nothing to get worked up about. I have had the IUD in place for 4 days now and have had minimal spotting and minimal cramping. I will update this is about three months. If you are considering the Mirena, please do not make your choice based on reviews from others. As I stated before people are quick to complain but rarely reach out to leave positive reviews.”",38

Due to getting my IUD. I was put on two antibiotics and further test were put on order. After taking the meds for one week, I still had pain and cramping at the same level when I first got it. However, I had developed a fever and nausea.  The Urgent care  doctor told me to go to the ER. At the ER they could not find my IUD imaging.

Hair loss, bad headaches, bad skin, back ache, joint ache ( couldn't run without knee pain ...

I ummed and erred for months because of negative reviews and my concerns were:
1) Would insertion hurt? The answer was no, I've had more painful cervical smears than the insertion of my mirena coil.
2) Would it mess with my monthly cycle? Yes, it did. I bled constantly, (in an array of colours!) for the obligatory 3 months that the GP told me to wait, until my body got used to it. Then it was another month before I finally went back to my GP and said ""Help"". She gave me a progesterone pill told me to take it for a month. I only took it for only one week! It did the job, I stopped bleeding and have gone on to a normal cycle. My periods only last a couple of days, do not hurt and are light, (just a smear of blood). I am 47 and compared to the heavy periods I was having before, it's a walk in the park.
3) Would I put on weight? No, not so far. I feel thinner around the middle.
4) Would I loose my sex drive? No, not so far. I was worried about this, however I am happy to say that I have noticed no difference. Sex is just as welcome and enjoyable as before.
5) Would I get spots? No. The doctor told me that this was less likely because the hormonal content is tiny and localised to the womb. She was right.
All in all it was the right decision for me. I am very happy. I hope this post helps others.”",46

I'm overwhelmed with anxiety, depression, brain fog, headaches and sore throat. I can't function. I think my  body has stopped making  progesterone (in the brain, adrenals and ovaries) because I have had the  artificial form from Mirena for 5+ years. It’s not localised hormone and isn't metabolised the same. When it’s removed your body is thrown into a severe imbalance that takes months to rectify.

I had no periods, that was the only pro to it. I never had zits before this but got cystic acne on my face horribly. I had horrible anxiety that made me feel like my neck was swelling and I couldn’t breathe. I had an erratic heartbeat randomly that would make me feel like I was going to pass out. Worst of all I was losing my hair so bad I ended up with. A tennis ball size bald spot on the top of my head. Once realizing this had to be the cause I had the mirena removed. I am glad to say that all of the horrible symptoms I had above went away after I experienced what is referred to as the mirena crash. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone!!”",19

The next morning I woke up I was in severe pain I couldn’t walk or sit. My whole abdomen was swollen and hurt if I barely touched it. My entire body felt sore , I was freezing cold and shaking I went to the ER. They took my blood and checked my vitals I had a fever and an infection. They took x rays and an ultrasound the Mirena was out of place and one of the T’s was poking into my abdomen. I was getting bags of antibiotics and morphine for pain which didn’t help my pain at all. The pain only went away after it was removed 2 days later. Now 4 days after removal I am still cramping , in pain , bleeding and very nauseous.”",22
MamaCass,Taken for less than 1 month,"June 10, 2014",9,0,"		“I decided to read the reviews for Mirena after I got it.  Wow am I ever glad I waited!  Reviews that stated spotting for months, and painful intercourse, would have been enough to put me off for sure.

However, I've had a fantastic experience with Mirena so far.  Spotted for 1.5 days (not months - DAYS) with only mild cramping.  Intercourse after 3 days, and it was as enjoyable, if not more so than before.

As I understand, it's better to have had children before using Mirena.  I can see why - insertion would likely have been more painful had I not had 1 child.

High recommendations, but of course, your doctor will know if Mirena is your best choice.  Right down to the tilt of your uterus - there are many factors to take into consideration.”",50

I spotted and had irregular periods for the first 2 months, it was really annoying. Then I spotted occasionally for another two months or so. My periods have stopped completely now so it was worth it. Also, the cramping was not bad at all. Nothing more than the moderate period pains I used to get. And my partner never notices it.”",49

About 6-8 months ago, I noticed a lot of symptoms like anger, depression, anxiety, excessive sweating, headaches lasting a week, but the WORST was hair loss. My hair became very brittle to the point I had to cut it short to blend in the breakage. I went to see my OB dr 2 weeks ago to get it removed and she didn’t seem to believe the mirena was causing these symptoms and refused to remove it until I get a 2nd opinion with a rheumatologist, which now I’m scheduled to see next week. My OB finally agreed to take the mirena out since my estrogen level came back very low. I’m just praying my hair starts to get back to normal with the nuvaring.

Issues: 
- Random dizzy spells that goes on for a week or two. I've never have dizziness before getting the Mirena IUD inserted.

 if you choose the Mirena be patient - the first year I constantly bleed off and on but then my period disappeared. Find a doctor who has done this a lot - I believe experience is the key! Also - have it done when your cervix is dilated during your period. I took Misoprostol for that the night before but that did not help.”",44

Don't listen to the bad reviews!
They will just freak you out, plus complications are extremely rare, especially if you ask the doc (not a nurse) about his/her personal stats. Side effects like moodiness, weight gain and acne are impossible! Less than 1% of the drug gets in your blood stream so it can't have the same side effects as most birth controls
The cervix softener and ibprofin really help with pain while lorazipam helps relax your muscles. Make sure you take them!

The cramping and expected bleeding/spotting stopped after about a week and I literally have noticed no side effects since. Also, I have dropped 5 lbs I believe due to the lack of hormones from the pill, so I'm back to my normal weight! Love this and would recommend to all.”",42

No weight gain no moodiness higher sex drive.. only one down is that my husband says he can feel a sharp poke when he penetrated deeply.

I am 23 and got it for contraceptive reasons and because I was sick of always having a 8 day period. I got my period for about 2 months straight and have been getting it on and off since pretty regular. Sometimes if I have sex it will bring on a period which is really annoying. I got VERY bad cramps for days after it was put in and now get much much worse cramps when I get a period which I never got before. I literally have to take pain meds as soon as they start if I don't I feel like I can feel the pain in my hips and bones almost which does sound weird. I think if you're going to get it just don't have the expectations that you will have no periods and it will all just be pain free.

First off to start off positive, it prevented pregnancy and lightened my periods as it promises BUT, after the first year I had chronic yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis which caused odor and discomfort, than to treat these I had to take antibiotics that caused yeast infections etc it was just just a mess. After 2 years on this birth control I gained 30 pounds and even with healthy eating and exercise I couldn’t shake the weight. I also dealt with depression, low self esteem and extreme anxiety.

Cramping lasted a few days and as I was bleeding when the insertion was done, I bled for probably 2 weeks afterward, but noticed instantly it was lighter each day. By 2 weeks after insertion I stopped bleeding; and have yet to have a period! I get the odd cramp here and there, but nothing that Advil or Panadol can't help!

KC,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"February 3, 2020",5,0,"		“The ONLY positive I can give you from my own experience with Mirena, is that it prevented pregnancy, made my cramps much less painful, and lightened my period. 
Now the negatives. Remember this is MY experience. 
1. My period was lighter &amp; shorter, however it came more often. Every 3 weeks instead of 4. I spotted probably 24-28 days a month. For over TWO YEARS. 
2. My hair became dry and brittle, &amp; I lost about a third of it. 
3. My teeth began to rot. This is a side effect not mentioned when your doctor tells you about it, nor on the websites. But in my own searching online, I've seen this one come up a lot with other women. 
4. My skin is dryer.
5. I don't get more breakouts, but the ones I do get are worse. Larger &amp; more painful.

In conclusion, yes Mirena works as a birth control. But do not forget there are several side effects that are always possible, and if you're like me you could be affected with more bad than good. I've had it removed for a week now and will not do it again.”",13

The insertion of the mirena was really painful. I have had kidney stones and insertion wasn't quite as bad as that. After 2 days of horrible cramping it went away. After 3 weeks of spotting/ bleeding I stopped and have not had any period since. I do have cramps sometimes. I have not gained or lost any weight. No hair loss. No changes in acne. The only thing I've noticed is that I now have lots
 of little fine hairs all over my chin and side of my face. Way more than before. Not a huge deal, but annoying. My boyfriend can not feel it at all and my sex drive is the same. So far I love it.”",31

I honestly thought I was really sick or feeling apart, my doctor RECOMMENDED me to stay on the Mirena even though I was convinced it was the source of all my new physical and emotional issues, they said that the two had no correlation... I have decided to change to a non-hormonal birth control alternative for the future to rebalance my hormones. Lesson is: listen to your body!”",13

I want to caution about one thing that has not been mentioned in any of the posts I have read.  After the first Mirena my new doctor insisted on an ultrasound before replacing it with a new one for 5 more years. I am grateful she insisted. I had 2 strawberry sized cysts - one on each ovary.  Easily treated with 3 months of birth control. The cysts disappeared and I was able to have a new Mirena. This insertion was very painful. In the hour afterwards I broke into a sweat and almost passed out. It has been 2 days and I'm much better, just light cramping.  Please get an ultrasound before replacing.  My doctor will also require follow up ultrasounds in 2 years.”",49

I'm in my early 20s and was hesitant to start other forms of birth control because it is hard for me to remember to take pills and I was worried about the weight gain. I've had no weight gain on Mirena and no extremely noticeable side effects. It was slightly painful to get inserted and I bled lightly for a few months afterwards but once that stopped it's been great. I tend to have spotting or a light period for one or two days every couple months but that's it.  It's great and so convenient.”,37

At one point I even hired a nutritionist and had a hard exercise regiment that I paid for and still gained more weight when everyone else lost about 30lbs....

I told her even all my coworkers that have it right now are experiencing the same issues so what does that tell you? She acted like she had an attitude because she couldn't talk me out of removing it, but I don't care it's my body my choice. I hope that this helps someone.

Insertion was a breeze, felt no pain, but let’s be honest, nothing compares to labor.  I got it inserted after I had my son. No pill to remember, no nasty side effects like cramps or moodiness. Best part is that I’m actually in the mood for sex! Pills always made me feel so “blah.”  I’ve had it inserted for 6 months and very happy. I can still tell when I ovulate but I do not get a period.

The vaginal odor and discharge I had was horrible for my sex life and my self confidence - there was nothing I could do to make it better. After speaking with my gynecologist, she mentioned that the strings from the IUD can cause repeated infections and odor since they collect and hold bacteria. I am now one month off of the IUD and everything is back to normal: no odor, no infections. I mentioned to my gynecologist that I also never had acne before having the mirena IUD, and she said that was also a very common side effect. The acne, infections, odor, and discharge were all negatively impacting my life. This birth control was great for the fact that it was very effective. I never had to worry about getting pregnant.

My side effects are constant, but worsen significantly during the week before my period starts. Overall I know everyone reacts differently, and these side effects are case-by-case.

-I haven't had any symptoms that I experienced with the pill (weight gain, acne, mood swings, hair loss)

Extreme sensitivity, crying spells, extreme anger, couldn’t handle the children or spouse anymore, patience disappeared. Extreme fatigue to this day.

Also have horrible bloating and developed hormonal and cystic acne. Just now having weight gain. Gained 11lbs these past 2 months, as much as 5 lbs in a week because of bloating.

Went right back to work. My doc gave me some pills to take a night before and 2 nights before to soften my cervix. The insertion felt like a bad cramp that lasted less than a minute. I’ve never had kids either. I don’t usually write reviews but I feel compelled to write a review about Mirena because before I got it I read so many reviews, a lot being negative about the pain or feeling it during sex, of course everyone’s experience is different and pain is subjective but my boyfriend can’t feel it, and it isn’t a wire hanging down like some say, the string is more like a fishing line, that can be shortened if it can be felt during sex.

Doc suggested we do Mirena because it is used to treat heavy periods, has no estrogen (which can contribute to high blood pressure) and circulates progesterone only in the uterus rather than systemically.

Sure before the thing I had heavy periods that needed double protection but at least it didn't last seven months strait and with other issues.”",11
Compass,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 18, 2019",6,0,"		“I had chosen the Mirena insert because I needed a more stable form of birth control. One that I didn't have to take pills everyday at certain times for, and one that was painless. The insertion was tolerable. I had it for about 6 months when I noticed that my periods were little to none. Then I noticed that I started gaining weight in my mid section and my thighs. I don't like it. I started feeling depressed. I've been having pelvic cramps/pain. My appetite has increased so much. I am eating excessively with no control and I know it's Mirena. I just feel icky.

After a few months I still felt really crampy but I held out hope that it would subside. It never did. I'm a fairly active person; going to the gym at least 4 times per week and I still managed to gain 35 pounds since the insertion. I also would get crippling migraines, mood swings that lead to serious bouts of depression, my sex drive is pretty much nonexistent.

I was literally so nervous going in because I work at a gyneoclogist office and I know a lot of people don't handle insertion very well. My doctor talked me through the entire process. First the tenaculum which is an instrument to hold your cervix in place, she told me to cough as she was clamping it and I didn't even feel it go on.  Then she used a ""sound"" to measure where she needed to insert the IUD. The sound felt very crampy and quite a bit of pressure but was not unbearable. As soon as she was finished measuring she inserted the IUD and cut the strings. I literally didn't even know the IUD was in because I didn't feel anything. I have only had a little bit of spotting when I use the restroom. Knowing this is good for 5 years and I don't have to remember to take it every day I would get it all over again. Such an easy process and I got myself worked up for something I barely felt. In my opinion the speculum hurt worse than the entire procedure.”",13

Shep,NA,"July 20, 2019",10,0,"		“I received the Mirena in 2012 with slight pain and cramping for 3 days. It was well worth it, because I never had another cycle, cramps, or mood swings during the duration of having the Mirena. 2017 arrived and it was time to replace my Mirena, but my insurance would not pay for a new one due to my provider changing. The cost was going to be $900.00 for removal and re-insertion. I did a lot of research and decided that I would keep in my Mirena for a few more years. I didn't want to switch to a cheaper BC and risk having a cycle again. I didn't want to pay for another Mirena because I wanted children in about 2 years. 
    My Mirena was removed May 2019 with no complications. I had the slightest spotting for a day. My cycle took 7 weeks before it resumed, and it was like I remembered it 7 years ago. I hope to have another Mirena put in after I have a child, it has been the best BC on the market for me.”",13

Super tolerable. So far I haven't had any negative side effects like I did with my previous IUD, and I am so happy I gave this a try. Don't let negative reviews deter you if you're contemplating it.

The OB was taking an ultrasound at the same time  as she was inserting it to check which direction my uterus was towards which helped instead of guessing (mine was forward which made it harder for her). We were both shocked when she asked if I was okay and didn't even know it went in. I then went home expecting cramping and it never came. I never had any cramping but only spotting. I then spotted for the whole of the first month but it really wasn't an issue. Only needed a panty liner. Now at 2 months I'm not spotting anymore and going amazing.

There was slight pain with insertion but my cervix had fully closed by that time. I had light spotting that day and nothing since. I am also breastfeeding so that might be why I am not bleeding like others. I have had no mood swings acne or weight gain. I do have a Masters in pharmacology and from an education background I can say most of those side effects people complain about are from your bodies adjusting from having a baby in you and then out of you.

- No acne.

I also have IBS which gives severe cramps. So seriously how bad could this be? The first few things they did didn't hurt, but once they started measuring my uterus, I was in excruciating pain. A procedure that should've taken 2-3 minutes, took about 10+ agonizing minutes. After almost passing out and hyperventilating, it was finally over. I have been home for the past few hours switching between walking, laying with a heating pad, and taking baths. The cramps are awful at times and then gone at other times.

I do not have a period anymore (which is great for saving $ on tampons!) although I do still have some symptoms of PMS each month.

Everything else is great! I rarely have periods &amp; when I do I just spot a little (I used to have very heavy periods &amp; BAD cramps). I also haven't ended up pregnant.

Year 3 depression hit, suicidal thoughts which scared me and led to do more research and found so many forums like this to give a story. Year 4-5 I got control of my mental health, the numbness was slowly going away, but still didn't have control over my feelings at this point climax during sex was non existent, sex drive was still there and periods were completely gone. Putting it on was painful and felt cramps for 3 days. The first doctor I went to needed to surgically remove it, but the second doctor took it out with out an issue zero pain no side effects and I started my period for the first time in 4 years on time. Huge pro ZERO kids, I was able to plan my life accordingly. Zero periods were cool. It felt 110% effective.

I had no desire to eat; food was unappealing. I lost 30 pounds in a little over two months. We started going to doctors; they said it’s stress and depression. We were afraid of cancer. I remained stable for about two months then lost another 10 pounds. I could not get any help from my HMO; they refused to say it was the implant. I decided to have it removed just short of six months. The weight loss stopped but the damage was done. The 40 pound loss triggered two rare syndromes called SMA and Nutcracker.

Jean,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"July 13, 2019",5,0,"		“I did not love Mirena. In the 2.5 years I had it, I had vaginal odor, lower libido, weight gain (25+ lbs), anxiety, and IBS symptoms. It did make my heavy periods much lighter, but did not improve cramps or PMS. I went back to normal fast after having it removed. Odor, anxiety, and GI symptoms went away, and I lost the weight. I had 3 months of super heavy ""rebound"" periods and now they are back to how they were before. I would recommend Mirena to anyone looking for reliable BC/lighter periods, with a caveat: If you notice bad effects, don't wait more than 6 months to see if they improve. Your doc may brush off your concerns. I have heard horror stories of women who suffered for years because their doc insisted they were exaggerating side effects, or that they must be caused by something else. I had 2+ years of side effects before I got it removed. Don't let your doc tell you you're wrong about how you feel. There are other options if Mirena isn't right for you.

Wow - I did nothing at all - no change to diet, exercise or eating patterns  - yes the reduction in weight and bloat had dramatically reduced my size literally in a few days.

Vagina Owner,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"December 8, 2020",5,0,"		“I got the Mirena IUD at 24 years old and had it removed a couple months ago after 3 years. During the first 2 years I had it, I got several stubborn yeast infections. It mostly couldn't be treated over the counter and needed fluconazole to go away and not come back a week later. The 3rd year I had the IUD, I had recurrent BV for nearly a full year. I tried conventional and unconventional treatment and the infection would keep coming back until I eventually got fed up and had the Mirena removed. Within 2 months, I was infection free! When I didn't have an infection, it worked well to reduce period cramps and bleeding (once I got past the 5 weeks straight of bleeding when it was first inserted).”",6
Jane,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"October 4, 2019",8,0,"		“I had Mirena inserted at my 6-week postpartum checkup. It hurt a lot when placing it, I was experiencing my first period since giving birth so the whole procedure was a mess. A week later I kept feeling the strings in the vagina, I could feel the device inside my uterus too. It was uncomfortable and so I went to the emergency room where they did an ultrasound and a vaginal exam. Everything came back normal.  The Mirena definitely helped stop the heavy bleeding I was having, then I got my period the next month then nothing.

I had the IUD removed last week due to the ongoing discomfort I felt. For the 10 months I had it in, I had low sex drive, no periods, the sensation that something was stuck in there, and a huge amount of hormonal-related mood swings. 

I now feel fantastic!! I feel happier, I feel nothing in my uterus or vagina that hurts. I enjoy being a woman again, though I have been spotting since having it removed for about one week.”",10

I had such an amazing experience with it the first time around, but now I'm trying everything in my power to have it taken the heck outta me - though the doctor(s, plural) insists on ""giving it another month"". How long do I need to suffer?

I had been having really bad pains for about 2 weeks on and off, didn't think much of it just figured it was cramps. Then it started getting worse only lasting 45 min.

A couple days ago I decided to go to the hospital because the pain was so unbearable. I told the Dr all the pain I was having. She said she was going to go talk with another Dr to try to figure out what to test me for. While I was waiting they had me pee in a cup for routine test...like a pregnancy test. They did the pregnancy test in the room with us..we were kind of making fun of it like yea right! No need for that I have an IUD! The nurse looked at me and said...YOU'RE PREGNANT! No way in hell!!! I knew immediately it wasn't good because of the pain and because I had an IUD! They took me for an ultrasound and then told me after that I was having a tubal pregnancy and I would need emergency surgery. What they didn't know is that my tube the baby was in had already burst and I was internally bleeding. They wheeled me down for surgery the last thing I remember is asking the Dr to take out my IUD. It was one of the scariest things that have ever happened to me! How did I get pregnant with an IUD that was in place? I don't understand it, but apparently it happens.

I got Mirena to start a job in a pharmacy. I didn't feel like asking my coworkers for my sprintec monthly.
Remembering back, insertion was a very deep pain felt intensely for 4 seconds, light headedness for 15-20 minutes, and BAD cramping for 2 hours. 
Periods: STOPPED as soon as inserted.
Weight : I LOST 25 lbs in the few months after. That could have also been due to my new job. My job included standing and no time for eating.
My mood: Haven't had swings like I would with sprintec and when I was getting periods.
So how about 11 months in now?
I have ACNE again. Like 5-8 pimples at a time. That has started in last 2 months.
So that is my 11 month update. Worse complexion is my biggest complaint. Having my one year check up in 2 weeks. Think I'll get a Rx to fight acne.

Then it dawned on me recently, what is it that changed after my son was born? Oh! Well I had the Mirena put in! I then started to research side effects and read forum posts by other women who have used Mirena, and to my surprise everything I have been suffering could be related to the Mirena!

I was pre-warned that the insertion can often be painful for women who haven't had a baby &amp; I was ok with that. Usually my pain threshold is high. It hurt to get in but I could handle that. Once it was in the cramps that followed were unbearable &amp; caused instant nausea, the doctor told me the pain would last 48 hours before it settles. I waited about 10 mins &amp; couldn't handle the pain anymore, I had to have it removed. The pain continued for about half an hour after that. The doctor said to come back after my next cycle &amp; they could try again with a smaller IUD but I refused. There's no way I am going through that again.”",8

I don't consider my pain tolerance very high but the pain was very bearable. I got it inserted while on my period. During my usual menstruation I get horrible cramps that will even cause me to vomit, but during the procedure the pain wasn't even close to that.

Insertion is best while you are in your menstrual cycle because it causes your cervix to dilate.

Insert gave a small cramp to my surprise much easier than I was setting myself up for in my mind.

Liz,NA,"April 27, 2019",5,0,"		“I'm 27 yo, have never had children and was recommended this due to my adverse reactions to other forms of birth control and my naturally heavy painful periods. 

The insertion was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. It was comparable to the pain I had when an ovarian cyst burst. I had to stay back in the doctors office for 3 hours after insertion due to the faintness and heavy pain it caused me.

I had ongoing cramps for a month after insertion. I still get intermittent cramping from the device but due to my incredibly painful natural cramps I've not been bothered by this.

My periods have reduced to very minimal bleeding. As someone with particularly heavy bleeds I was very happy with a 3 days of light flow.

However I have acne like I've never seen before, I have weird swelling in my lower abdomen that has been impossible to get rid of and I am quite sure it has lowered my mood and caused weight gain (though those two things I can't conclusively prove).”",10

Factual Nurse,NA,"December 15, 2019",6,0,"		“I loved the Mirena because it was an effective form of birth control and did not give me mood swings or anxiety and depression like all other hormonal BC has.

My periods stopped for a year but then came back, but not heavy and very minimal cramps, so I did not mind. I noticed an increase it appetite, but no weight gain since I stuck to eating healthy and exercising. However, my hair thinned out tremendously which is I’m getting it removed. This is caused by the synthetic progestin released by the Mirena causing a hormonal imbalance in your body. I also experienced increased facial hair growth and hair growth in other undesired areas. In addition, an increase in occurrences of yeast infections. I thought I was going crazy with my hair thinning out, but I researched and many other women had the same problems.”",8

For the side effects: Heavier and longer periods even though the side affect of the hormonal IUD is supposed to do the opposite. No weight gain. Never had strong cramps but now I get them really bad. Hormones?  Recently after drinking I have gotten emotional and had emotional outbreaks. I also have gotten waves of sadness out nowhere?

Also, if you want to get pregnant just have it removed and within 2 weeks you can get pregnant. I would rate this an 11/10.”",22

Who knows if it works because I haven’t had sex since my insertion, I’ve had a handful of days where my bleeding was light. I’ve had enough of having tampons in, pads, all of it.  I’ve had my mirena checked at 3 and 6 months, it s in the correct place without complications and I have no explanation as to why I’m still bleeding.

1. This IUD does not cause acne, but it lacks estrogen like the pill or other forms of birth control that help with clearing up acne. So you may get more pimples than usual but its what you would normally have with out the pill.

At this point I wouldn't advise bc at all but obviously people use it for other reasons besides getting pregnant. Nevertheless, the hormonal imbalance and emotional toll is not worth it! I pray after all of this I can even conceive another child. I don't know this for a fact: but I feel like there's got to be some kind of extra financial gain for OBs when they insert Mirena.

mrsR,NA,"January 26, 2020",9,0,"		“I have been using Mirena for almost 7 years.  I had it inserted after my youngest child was born.  I have had a very good experience with it up until recently.  Almost no periods, minimal cramping/moods.  I kept my first in over 6 years- read the UK studies.
I had it replaced a month ago and about a week ago I suddenly broke out with an itchy, hivey like rash all over my torso, arms, stomach, lower back - it has become worse over the week and last night was the first night it really disturbed my sleep. I have been racking my brain for the cause and suddenly the idea of the mirena came into my head like a lightbulb. After 2 hours of early morning internet research, I strongly believe that is the case. Hives and rash are listed as a possible side effects on their website and there are various message boards where women tell their mirena rash stories.  The rash can start weeks, months or even years after insertion.  I am distressed.  Also, getting my old device removed was VERY painful.”",7

Cons: insertion is fairly painful, I got lightheaded during insertion and it feels like the worst cramping you could imagine. 
Also and the biggest thing for me is the weight gain. I had stayed around 151-157 for about the last 10 years. Since getting the Mirena I have steadily gained weight. I'm now around 167. I used to just be able to clean up my eating and lay off the junk food when I noticed I was putting in a few pounds and be back to normal. Not anymore. I'm really considering having it removed.

I'm 18 years old and I've never had a baby, I got the Mirena to use as a form of birth control. I took 880 mg of aleve 1 hour before my appointment and the whole process took maybe 10 minutes. I've only had one Pap smear before and she even had to dilate me a little bit but it didn't hurt worse than my worst period cramps- you just have to breathe through it. I had light spotting for the rest of the day and some mild cramps that felt better when I laid down and used a heating pad. Now I'm in no pain at all and I am happy and have energy and am VERY happy that I got this done!”",16

Then came the ACNE - cystic acne on jawline and cheeks and on my back, which I've NEVER had before in my life!!! At 37yrs this was a BIG set back. I could have dealt with the pain of insertion if the effects of Mirena were good but they were not. In the last month I had every gynaecological problem you could think of, again, never had before in my life. This also meant that my GP could not remove it until things settled down, which led to an expensive visit to the gyno to have it taken out.

2) It could fall out/re-position itself in the cervix, (down from uterus). 5mos after a copper/hormone-free IUD, I found out that this had happened to me and I switched back to Mirena.

Many people have had adverse effects from this med. incl. depression, anxiety, mood swings, constant spotting, painful cramps+.

Having 5 years of experience on this med., then switching to a copper IUD for 5mos, I can say that Mirena has HELPED my depression/anxiety.  Every body is different. Plus I'm not going to get pregnant! So, all in all, I'd recommend this to anyone.”",14

CONS (mind you this is my personal experience and everyone receives this birth control differently): painful insertion had cramps the rest of the day. Painful menstral cramps. Irregular periods.

BUT, Mirena gave my severe acne and pretty bad pelvic, lower back and uterine pain. During intercourse, it would cause nauseousness because I could feel it moving (even though the website and doctors tell you that’s not possible).   I was so confused because all of my friends who had them loved them. Went in for regular and vaginal ultrasounds to test for endometriosis, tested negative. Finally after 16 months decided to get it removed. All of the symptoms listed above went away.

I’m not saying to never use the Mirena (no horror story here and many people LOVE it), just if you have gotten it in and are unhappy with it, trust your gut, your body is trying to tell you something. Better safe than sorry :)”",8

My periods are usually 4 days long and never have any cramping. I do tend to get overwhelmed about 4-7 days before my period. My emotions are more challenging to rein in. I do get ovulation pain. I thought that an IUD would level out the hormones and make my emotions easier to manage. I had an IUD on Friday 09/27/2019. I spent 24 hours in cramping pain and tiredness. Lots of brown discharge in the first day. The progestin made me bloated/gassy. Saturday and Sunday I felt in a brain fog and couldn't think clearly or just enjoy being (just like when I was on micronor).

The only positive is I haven't gotten pregnant. I  also had a bad experience with the bar (had periods that lasted 3 weeks with only one week off between),  so if you're like me in that regard be cautious about getting mirena.

But I took two paracetamol and went in completed relaxed listening to music. if you stress you will tighten up and it will inevitably hurt more. 
Yes it hurt,but for about 5 mins. I bled the first day, but not since. It's been three months, no spotting or bleeding at all. Incredible, best decision I made. Pain killers+relax=success”",15

What I like best about it, besides not having to take the pill everyday, is that I only have my period every other month if that. I definitely would recommend it if you hate taking the pill and aren't thinking about having kids anytime soon. Luckily my Mirena was free through the local health center. Definitely worth it!”",18

Following insertion I did have some more cramping, but I used a heating pad, took more pain killers, and went on with my day. There was some bleeding in the days after, but it has mostly cleared up for me now. I love not having to take a birth control pill everyday. To anyone nervous about getting Mirena, don’t be!

Haley,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"August 22, 2019",5,0,"		“The Mirena did exactly what it was meant to do - I am not pregnant! I had Mirena for 1.5 years, and it was a great form of low maintenance birth control. My period was 1 day long and incredibly light. But those are the only nice things I have to say about it. 

The insertion was excruciatingly painful, I ended up fainting in the exam room. I have never had issues with my periods, but I had horrific cramps for the first 3 months. I continued to have horrible cramps on and off. Sex became increasingly painful, so my GYN did an ultrasound. Turns out, the Mirena had caused a 6 cm cyst on one of my ovaries! The last straw was when I was hit with a wave of cramps so hard I had my boyfriend drive me to emergency room. I had it removed the next day. 


All in all, I believe that someone who has had a child would do better with Mirena than I have. If it hadn’t caused horrific cramps, I would have been pleased with it.”",7

Never had bad cramping, no headaches, no weight gain, no acne change, no bad side effects like some claim. Only bad side effect was a bad vaginal odor, that became much less severe when removed.

The only negatives I have about Mirena is that it does hurt sometimes during sex if the intercourse gets a little intense. Also, I am completely convinced that it is the cause of my weight gain.

Since the one year mark, I get my period consistently every month and it’s way lighter than before the IUD. Since my periods have adjusted, the only negative side effect I’ve had is a decrease in sex drive (went from having sex multiple times a day to maybe wanting it once a week).

I lost my insurance until recently, and I just went to get it taken out after 2.5 years of pain. Turns out my uterus is inverted and too small to fit an IUD comfortably.

CNM80,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"January 1, 2016",8,0,"		“I have loved having my Mirena for almost 3 years now. I prefer it to the regular non-hormonal IUD because it greatly reduced (almost diminished) my monthly bleeding. As a health professional (nurse practitioner), I have recommended and inserted this to many women seeking long term forms of birth control. The initial pain /cramping at insertion was helped by the use of ibuprofen before insertion and for 24-48hours after. However! I have gained a lot of weight after inserting my Mirena (which didn't occur when I used the copper IUD - lost 25lbs with that one) So it loses marks for that reason as far as I'm concerned. If you have a tendency to gain weight easily, I'd be careful. I know a lot of women that are happy with it without problems.”",13

Nothing works to get rid of it.  I went to a dermatologist and he prescribed several items for me none of which worked.  I have another appointment to go in a couple of days.  There is a medicine that apparently works (I did lots of research online) that's called spironolactone that's used for high blood pressure and acne as well as a few other things.

I got an ultrasound yesterday and everything looked fine. I'm not saying not to get Mirena, but I strongly recommend considering other options or being okay with dealing with the side effects.

Following the procedure, a friend took me home because of the cramping it caused but after a couple hours I felt okay to drive. There was spotting for a month and slowed down to the point I now spot maybee 2 days a month. I've now had it for 5 months and get cramps from time to time but they arent bad ones.

My gyno warned me that side effects take 3-6 months to go away. I randomly spotted for the first 2 months or so - not terrible, just annoying. The one side effect that I didn't like was that when my period would normally be happening, I wouldn't bleed, but I would get really light-headed/zoned out for a few days.

I've heard that some doctors can give you a numbing shot for the insertion and I would highly recommend this if, like me, you are a young woman who has never given birth or experienced horrible period cramps before. I spotted for about a month after getting the IUD, but after that month I no longer get my period! I also lost about 10 pounds with absolutely no lifestyle changes...just didn't have all of the hormones from oral birth control in my system anymore!

Some people say it doesn’t hurt that bad but everyone is different. I’ll start with the pros; GREAT at preventing pregnancy! We never used condoms once (he did pull out) so that was a huge bonus! I never had to remember to take the pill or change the patch which was fantastic for me because I forget things easily. I believe that it definitely helped with my acne.

On top of this I would have extremely painful periods in which I would lay around all day and take close to 12 Advil daily.

The day I got it in (Monday) I couldn't get out of bed for around 5 hours after as it was just serious cramping which is normal and is your body adjusting, Day two was normal period like cramps and slight discharge.

I took 800mg ibuprofen and 5mg of the anti-anxiety med Ambien (which my Dr. prescribed) 45 minutes before the insertion. My Dr. decided to insert it under sonogram guidance to ensure it was fit perfectly. 
The actual insertion pain lasted 45 seconds to 60 seconds tops. I would describe the pain as a 3-4 because it is so fast! It’s no worse than a muscle cramp, stubbing your toe, or any sort of pain we women endure often. After the insertion my Dr. did an internal sonogram to confirm it was fit perfectly. I have literally had no pain or cramping at all since insertion and feel as if it never even happened. 
I believe my success has to do with the medicines/sonogram guidance: so if you are nervous ask if your Dr. is open to these things! Just know everyone’s pain will be different and you never know until you try!”",7

My strings have retracted into my cervix and I am likely going to have a difficult extraction. While the Mirena has been effective birth control, it has been an almost constant uncomfortable one. My partner at times feels the strings during intercourse and I still at times have heavy cramping and menstrual discharge. The hormone in Mirena is progestin and it does not suppress ovulation.

First week was uncomfortable, I can feel it as I move around. There was no bleeding. 2nd week was when the bleeding started and lasted for a month. It took 3 weeks to stop feeling the IUD.

Up until 2 months ago I have occasional spotting, but only for a day whereas I used to get heavy bleeding and cramping that I have to take Advil.

I didn’t see any weight gain, mood swings, acne. My sex drive is still the same, however there was a couple of times where I could feel it during sex which was uncomfortable. The last few times I had sex, I didn’t feel it at all and no spotting from those times.

I did notice that I’m a lot warmer than before.

My gyno recommended switching me to an IUD since I have no desire for children in the future. The insertion process was extremely painful for me. I had awful cramps for a week after I got it. I even had to get the dr to write me a prescription for pain medication so that I could tolerate going to work. I consider myself someone that can tolerate a high amount of physical pain but getting the Mirena put in it was a terrible experience. I do not want another one after the 5 years is up.”",14

Not had a period in 7 years, not even spotting - even when I had the old one replaced...

I could notice the string for the first couple of days but I never notice it now. It's helped with my cycle a tremendous amount. I originally got it because I was getting my period every 2 weeks instead of once every month and now I'm back to once a month and it's very light and only last a couple days.

Now for the side effect. I have become increasingly aware that I have extreme mood swings more frequently. I just thought that I was depressed by life events but lately it has been more of a roller coaster of manic mood swings. After some research I found this to be a common side effect.

The 9th year I was struggling with not being able to loose any weight no matter how hard I tried. Hind sight is always 20/20, so looking back I also had low libido for years, never knew why. Not to mention the 70 lbs I gained. I got it out in January 2018 because of the weight gain. I immediately lost 10 lbs in the first 2 months. I did get pregnant in April and still continued to loose, even pregnant. I was not even sick. Now (post baby) I have lost a total of about 30 pounds. I'm in my mid 30s so I thought it would be harder to loose weight than when I was in my early 20s (when I first got Mirena) but it's been easier since removing Mirena! Never again. I now have a copper IUD Which is causing heavy bleeding. So I will give it about 6 months. Hopefully it gets better otherwise I'm going for tying my tubes.

I got very serious with my, now, fiancé and decided that this would be a good option for BC.  I got an appt with my OBGYN and discussed it.  She spoke highly of it.

So I tried the pill but I had to get taken off of it due to my migraines. I was seventeen when I first got my IUD. Now I have a high tolerance for pain so getting the Mirena placed was a breeze. They used ultrasound and were finished in less than five minutes! About a half hour after I left the office I had extreme cramping. Most painful thing I have ever felt, but it only lasted about two to three hours. After that for about three months I had light spotting. Now I don't have any bleeding after having it close to two years,  but I do get the occasional cramps here and there, but nothing significant.

Previously I had been on Sprintec for 2 years, and NuvaRing for about the last two months before my Mirena placement. My reason for switching from Sprintec was that I would no longer be on a schedule where I could take a pill at the same time every day. NuvaRing was awful and caused me to bleed for a month straight, so I decided to try Mirena. 

The insertion was definitely painful, there's no denying that. But, the pain lasted maybe 10 seconds at the most. By the way, I have never had children.. I had pretty bad cramping for the first day after insertion. I stopped bleeding about 3-4 days after insertion (after a month of bleeding from NuvaRing!) and feel great now!

Mina,NA,"July 18, 2019",8,0,		“This will be my 4th Mirena. First was for birth control and was good. The insertion was a bit painful . The first was for contraception and I didn't have periods during five years. I did feel a bit moody on the first year. When  expired I had it removed and fitted a new one on the same day.. All was well for two years when I started bleeding after intercourse. The Mirena had moved and couldn't be found so I had to have it removed by hysteroscopy day surgery. I bled heavily for months after that but it could also be because I have fibroids and on the peri-menopause. The excessive bleeding has been going on for 2 years and the doctor recommended the Mirena again but I was  unsure  Went ahead anyway because the options to reduce the bleeding was taking hormones orally or having my uterus removed . 3 months had Mirena inserted but it came out after 3 days. Yesterday had it put in. Fingers crossed that will stay in and sort the heavy bleeding. I will come back  let you know how it goes.”,6

Seashellz,Taken for less than 1 month,"December 12, 2019",9,0,"		“Everyone’s body reacts differently to different products. For me the depo shot was a horrible experience and I ended up getting pregnant while taking birth control pills, so I decided to give this a Mirena a go. It was a very quick procedure -less than 2 minutes- and felt like a little pinch. It’s been 3 days now, the cramping has subsided, I do feel like I can feel the device still, but it doesn’t hurt it’s just a weird feeling.
Cons:
- I could feel the device in my uterus, it felt like a little poking sensation. It was uncomfortable for me and the cramps made me feel nauseous 
- I’m hungry more often now
- anxiety due to the fact that I can’t see it so I’m constantly worrying if it moved
Pros:
- I only had discharge for the first day
- it lasts 5 years
- hassle free
- very good at preventing pregnancy
- more intense sex
       Tips:
If you have heavy periods, severe cramps, Nausea, or persistent abdominal pain report this to your OB”",5

This is my experience getting Mirena put in at age 26. This is my 100% truthful opinion and experience. No children or anything so my cervix is tiny. There is a reason I guess they recommend it specifically to woman who have had a kid. The insertion process was incredibly uncomfortable and painful as hell and I never will do it again. The ""cramp"" they described was an understatement. I almost passed out, I had a miserable and painful first month after insertion. I have gained 10+ lbs of weight without diet or activity changes, and got some crazy deep stretch marks on my tummy as a result. I've never stopped spotting during periods. And the side effects are noticeable for sure, regardless what ""percentage"" they advertise. It can affect you, and it sucks. Yes, the pros sound so awesome initially, for sure. I hope it is a better process for you, but just commit to a pill daily would be my best advice. Or just use spermicide and condoms and watch your cycle.”",6

I missed the next day of school and work because I was in so much pain. After about the 4th day, the pain and cramps finally started to subside. I bled for about 3 months after.

Lethargy. Zero energy and cannot get enough sleep.

I tried remedial facial products, healthy eating, lots of fluid - unable to clear the acne, get the weight to budge. Only recently have I linked it to having the Mirena IUD.

My gynecologist gave me misoprostol to take 3 hours before the procedure and 600 mg of ibuprofen. The insertion was extremely painful for me, but the procedure only took about 10 minutes. After the procedure I had some cramping and a brown discharge for the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and felt great. Ever since I have not had any problems except for some bleeding the first 2 weeks which is normal and easily controlled by using a light pad. The insertion was very painful, but SO worth not worrying and about getting pregnant and taking the pill perfectly. If you can take a day of pain I recommend this full heartily. Mirena is awesome”",8

Nothing to think about, no periods, etc. My mood is more stable and sex drive is greater than it was when I was on Yasmin. Being 26 years old and never having children, the insertion was extremely painful and I was very nauseous. It only took about 3 minutes to put in, but I was out of commission for the first week following. My doctor gave me some stronger medicines since the ibuprofen wasn't working and nausea wasn't subsiding, and that helped a lot. Since then, I've been good to go! No acne, no weight gain.”",9

I quickly broke into a cold sweat, got very pale, so dizzy, and had terrible nause, my blood pressure also dropped extremely low. I laid on the table in the doctors office for about an hour until I got myself together, but still had to call someone for a ride home. Afterward I had terrible cramping for about 2 weeks, along with bleeding. My doctor said the cramping was due the fact that my uterus was so small because I have never had any children, so I was just getting used to it being there. The cramping has since went away ( It is over a month later ) but I am still bleeding, it is way less than a period, not clotty either. When I think it's done, it will start again. My doctor said it is just what your body does until it gets used to it. Other wise I have no complaints, other than the bleeding being EXTREMELY inconvenient and becoming expensive ( tampons ) but I have already come this far so I'm going to wait it out before having it removed because I am not in any pain. But I haven't lost my sex drive ( it's gotten better if anything ) , I have not gained any weight, small amount of acne but nothing I can't handle lol.

I would definitely recommend it.”",17

McHeidi,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"May 2, 2017",1,0,"		“I was excited to get it, but the insertion was very, VERY painful, even with local anesthesia.  I bled for a long time and it was very uncomfortable to sit in certain positions.  My periods were very different, with prolonged bleeding (not the short, sweet periods the advertisements promise).
I also noticed that I had started to smell badly down there.  I kept going to the doctor for it (the other doctor who cared for IUD patients, not MY doctor) and he kept telling me that it was a ""bacterial imbalance"" and not related to my IUD.  It most certainly was because my cervix was always open from the string.  This ceased after removal.
Also, it does not prevent conception.  It causes fertilized eggs to be discharged because they can't implant.”",8

I would recommend taking advill extra strength gel caps, those seem to work the best for me. Hours after I got mine done I was in a bunch if pain. I had really bad cramps, fever and I was puking which was not fun at all. But the next day all the pain went away and I felt like myself again. I only bled for three days after getting it in then it completely went away and I am in no more pain!

The first month I had a mild headache and mild spotting daily. Year 2, at best I had 2 irregular periods a year. Year 3 &amp; 4 the depression started to set in, suicidal thoughts came as well. I just had mine removed about a week ago and I feel like a dark cloud has been removed. I made it to 4 years and 8 months, but I decided enough was enough with feeling like that. I do not take any daily medications that could have caused an interaction either.

In the beginning, after having it in, it is a rough ride. Bad cramping, bleeding for a month straight. Once that stops and ur body  adjusts, it's pretty nice to not have to think about birth control. I still PMS, get cramps, and have spotting around the time I would be having my period but not anything like how it was naturally. I have concerns about long term affects bc I'm only 21 and I would love to have babies one day, just not right now.

NOTE: BREATHE!!! Can't stress enough. Thankfully I have an excellent doctor who coached me thru. I had taken ibuprofen before, and took the cervix softener (whatever it's called) about 8 hours prior. She also numbed with lidocaine. Very helpful so ask for it!
When breathing ask for the doc to tell u when insertion is happening. Take deep breath right before and out. That way the cervix will open to allow for easy insertion. Otherwise it's more so forced and the after pain is greater. 
There's a connection between our jaws and cervix. So don't hold your breath or bite down but breath thru so less pain.

I was able to drive home, but had major cramping for about 2-3 days.  At the 3 month mark, I noticed my mood was very apathetic all the time. I had no highs or lows, which is pretty infuriating. I gained 8-10lbs without any diet change, my hair thinned/broke easily, I broke out on my back and chin/neck and my sex drive lessened. To feel like myself, I had to get acupuncture every month to level out my hormones. It helped a little. The only plus is that my period mostly disappeared after 2 months. I would spot once in a while, but only for a day or so. I got it removed (no pain at all &amp; easy) and got pregnant with my first baby easily 3 months later with zero complications.”",5

I think it's important to remember EVERY woman is different - different bodies, different tolerances &amp; take into account age, health, fitness &amp; so on.

The insertion was the worst pain I’ve ever felt. I lost a lot of blood, 10/10 pain, and I immediately felt dizzy/nauseous. I had to stay in the doctors office for an hour until I felt better.  I had cramping for a day or two. Over the next 6 months, I spotted constantly (annoying!). But I also lost some stubborn weight, and I felt more energetic. Fast forward to a 1 yr later and I was the leanest and happiest I’ve ever been. I know this contradicts other people’s experiences, but my body adjusted after a few months. I did also get one ruptured cyst at year 2 (not nearly as painful). 

I am now thinking about having it removed as I have a feeling that it is wearing off (PMS returning - cramping, breast tenderness, mood swings, weight gain).”",5

No problems with brittle nails or hair. I have never felt any pain from the threads, neither has my husband.

Other side effects included terrible mood swings , debilitating migraines, depression and anxiety, hair loss and some spots . 
I had never suffered with any of these conditions before the coil.
Blood test show my hormones are totally out of whack which certainly explains my symptoms. 

When I had the coil out, the strings had been cut too short meaning I had to have an instrument pushing through my cervix into my womb, the pain was so bad I cried. 
I was NEVER told or advised  about possible side effects/removal issues.

I think health care professionals push these things on to women without giving them all the objective information needed to make informed decisions over their own bodies!!!!”",6

In January 2016, I had a positive pregnancy test and my IUD was missing (later found sideways in the top of my uterus). A week later, I had an ultrasound and was told I had miscarried. Although we did not want another child for another 2 years, having a miscarriage was one of the worst experiences ever, not to mention the pain and discomfort from have the Mirena moving.

Since then, I've had no real periods but a lot of unpredictable spotting and light bleeding, as well as cramping, that lasts for upwards of 3 weeks on end, sometimes with only one week in between.

It was incredibly uncomfortable to get it inserted, and I bled for 3 months straight after with little to no breaks. 
After this ended, the following months were fine...however whenever my period came I would get excruciating cramps that lasted 1-2 days non stop. 
Not to mention my period occurs every 2 weeks now and lasts 2 weeks long as well, so I only have 2 weeks in between every period and it’s absolutely miserable for me. I have also almost completely lost my sex drive (keep in mind I am 20 years old). I have tried libido supplements for women of many brands but nothing seems to work.

Ask me in a few weeks but right not the answer is NO. I felt a wave of intense cramps (uncomfortable but fine) and then a stabbing and sensation that caused me to scream and cry in pain.

Even so, it was very fast and if Mirena works as I’ve been told I would do it again. I had cramps for 3 days but they were not bad at all. 

I’m still not very convinced of having it as a birth control because the doctor told my partner and I that It’s possible it could move and end up not working as it’s supposed to. Because of it they have to check it regularly if it’s still in place; so, how can I be comfortable and sure that I will not end up pregnant? I don’t know...

Took my body 8 months to adjust fully and has been great ever since. The biggest benefit for me is I no longer have painful ovarian cysts.

I'm 21 years old I've had a lot of problems with my left ovary since I was 14yearsold. I tend to get a lot of cysts on it yet my right ovary is perfect. My gynaecologist suggested that after trying so many pills I was still getting cysts and my periods were horrendous, to try the Mirina coil WORST decision of my life. 
At first they tried for 45 minutes to get it in and it would not go so I was told to come back in 2weeks which I did and again it took a lot of trouble and took 1hr and 25 mins until it was in place. After it was in it was just like period cramping. A week after this my stomach bloated making me look 5/6 months pregnant and the pain was excruciating! 1week after having it put in I've had it removed!”",8

Mirena, which at my docotr's office cost $750, is cheaper than paying $20/month for birth control. In addition, my insurance payed all but $200.

During the consultation, my doctor measured my uterus. I was half of a cm smaller than what the package insert recommended. So we waited until I was on my period to measure again- I was exactly at the minimum. Taking a chance, I decided to try the Mirena.

The actual insertion was painful. It felt like the worst poo cramp in the world- but it was over quickly. I had cramping for about 2 hours, and with advil, I was fine. My period stopped immediately.

I have only had it for a month now but I love it.

The following few hours and days, you get period cramps periodically, just like a regular period.Then through out the next few months I would have cramping randomly (mostly b/c my body needs to get used to the hormones and stuff).The first few months I needed to use day liners for about 1-2 days,no divacups, or tampons needed. I now don't even need to use liners at all. I still get some spotting that may need a liner for 1 day but that is all. I haven't had any weight gain, acne at all.

Every once and a while I will get the breast tenderness, but it's not much worse then when I was breastfeeding and often goes away in minutes. I have a horrible time remembering to do things, so when I was taking a pill everyday I had to rely on my cellphone alarm going off to take the pill and even then if it wasn't close by or if I was in the middle of doing something I wouldn't stop to go take the pill. I love that I don't really have to worry about it.  My doctor told me since I hadn't been getting my period while breastfeeding, Mirena would more then likely stop my periods, which so far I haven't even spotted one day.  I haven't had any problems with weight gain. I have maintained the same weight as when it was inserted, though I am trying now to start losing weight, so we shall see how that goes.

Of course I'm tired I have one son who is 2 1/2 and another is 10 months old. Any hair loss I had was coordinated with stopping breast feeding, and so far no cramping/migraines outside the normal.

BEFORE Mirena, my highest recorded weight was 170 lbs. I ate junk all day and never exercised. After I began working out and eating clean, I dropped down to a stable 130 lbs. AFTER Mirena, noticed a slight weight gain, and almost 2 years later, I now weigh 190 lbs!!! I'm running miles every day, eating well and I'm STILL gaining weight.

Cramping and spotting for the rest of the day, and occasional cramping for the following week. Cramping was significantly better on days after evening work outs.

My partner cannot feel the strings during sex, and I have no idea that the IUD is there. There is no reason for me to believe that I should begin to have more side effects down the road, because a few weeks in all spotting and cramping has subsided.”",8

No more heavy periods and no more pain. Do not always listen to the reviews on here. Especially the bad ones.

I am eating about 1600 - 1800 calories per day (about 500 lower than my normal consumption while training for marathons) and I cannot lose the weight.

When I started dating, I decided to start birth control and I chose implanon, it was a worst decision.. Spotting for almost everyday, very bad mood changes.. Always hungry. So after we got married I decided to move to some other birth control and My dr suggested me mirena, and I got inserted few months back, there is hormone in it, but it's locally at the utress. Insertion was uncomfortable, I would suggest everyone to have some pain medicine before. I had normal cramps for few days, no bleeding. Since then my cramps came

Right afterwards I was told the bleeding and soreness was normal for the first several weeks. As told, the bleeding and pain eventually stopped but yeast infections, feminine odor, discharge and dryness became regular.  I also gained weight. The only good thing was that it was preventing pregnancy. After 2 years my relationship ended and I couldn't wait to get it out.

I am a 21yr old female who has never had children, with extremely light periods that last about 3 days (prior to having this inserted).

Also threw up six times and got diarrhoea. Strange! The following 5 days light spotting, then light period (as planned) for about a week. 
It's now been almost 8 weeks since insertion, got my second period which was very light compared to being on the pill. Apart from the horrible insertion I'm very content with mirena, absolutely worth it!

Monthly, I'm supposed to check the string to make sure mirena is still in place, and doing so after my first period, there was a thick white discharge that smelled sour and wouldn't go away even after douching daily. I got myself checked for an infection because it was accompanied by itching when it first started (no multiple partners)  I thought it was a yeast infection, but I was clear; no infection at all.

Periods have gotten *significantly* lighter, to the point where I can leave my Lunette menstrual cup in for 12 hours and it's not even half way full.

I am a 26 year old with no previous children, I say this as it is often recommended for people who have already had kids. I am married and I plan to stay on it for about three years. 

The insertion process was a lot like having a Pap smear. It did not take very long however it was very painful (9/10) for about a minute. Afterwards I experienced a lot of cramping and discomfort for the rest of the day. I feel like although it was an unpleasant experience in the long term it is totally worth it. I never had major problems with the pill either however I did experience mood swings and a low libido. I also didn't like the fact that I had to remember to take it daily and I would often fail to take it at a consistent time.

The insertion only felt a little crampy. Then they gave me a shot to ease the pain. I went in for 2 different check ups &amp; everything was perfect! Most days I forget it’s there. No reason to worry about the pill. I haven’t experienced any weight gain or acne. Which is great!!! My last periods have been GREAT! No cramps, less flow. The only thing I would warn is you WILL spot quite a bit for the following 2 months after insertion. That is TOTALLY normal. And then it goes away. I feel so great &amp; love having painless periods. I would recommend this to anyone! Young or old. Whether you've had kids or not. It’s the best ever!!! Plus it last 5 years! The best thing!”",5

Previously, I'd get perhaps two pimples/year which would heal quickly without much of a trace. My face also looked puffier.

It seemed that no matter what I ate or drank, my stomach was constantly bloated. Before insertion, I weighed 135 pounds. Now, after 7 months with it, I’m up to 160 pounds.

Insertion was so issue at all about three hours after I started feeling like rubbish, wasn’t worried as she said I might feel a bit crampy etc. 

By Friday, I couldn’t walk, the pain was unbearable.. ended up going to emergency for it. 
Now Sunday, I’m calling tomorrow to get it out, I read the good comments and the bad before getting it put in, thinking I would be one of the ones to have a good review. 

Highly do not recommend unless you can put up with severe pain, bloating, heavy bleeding etc.

I'm concerned that the hormones are no longer affecting me as they did for 3 years and perhaps Mirena is the cause for this extreme case of acne.

I loved having mirena for 5 years as I didn't have to worry about birth control at all! 
The only minus is that for first year or two I had irregular bleeding or to be correct spotting.  It wasn't really a period but every couple of weeks I'd have to use slim daily pads for couple of days at a time. Still, it is much much better than having regular painful periods and to worry about birth control every day. 

So, I'm having my removed in a month and probably will give my uterus a rest for 2-3 month (if it's necessary I don't know... Maybe not) and get another one.”",7

I had mild cramping for a day after insertion, my biggest complaint was that I had some minor spotting for 4-6 months afterwards.

Mirena is marketed as being effective for 5 years but the physicians assistant I saw maybe a year after said that research has shown it to be good for up to 7 and in Europe it’s marketed as 7.

I had never linked all of it to the Mirena, until a friend mentioned it. Set up an appointment to get it removed in two days, and only after read all of these reviews.

Having it inserted felt like reverse labor and I dunno if I will be able to handle labor without drugs after that experience. I almost fainted after the procedure. I am still having on and off cramping, and I'm spotting, so hopefully it will work out once my body gets used to it. I just wish they would have warned me about how painful it was going to be before they did it so I was prepared.”",10

When comparing my Mirena to my first IUD Skyla, I think there's a few differences. Skyla gave me nauseating cramps and shortened the time between periods from 28 to 21 days. I only have light spotting once a month with Mirena and no cramps. Mirena lasts longer, which is nicer.

I do get some occasional spotting, but my periods are very light and there's no horrid cramps like I had when I was on the pill before I got pregnant.

A friend of mine had Mirena put in 2 years ago, when we were both 25. She absolutely loved it and recommended it to me.

If it lasted longer I would of had it out by now cause the pain is unreal. I am happy about no periods  hopefully it will settle.

I got Mirena inserted yesterday at my local Planned Parenthood. The insertion was VERY painful. I would rate it an 8/10, with 10 being ""pass out"" pain. Luckily, it lasted for about 3 minutes total. I admittedly cried and broke out in a cold sweat uncontrollably on the table, but remembered to breathe which saved me...remember to breathe!! I had to stay laying on the table for about 5 minutes after it was done because I felt dizzy. Honestly, I think my reaction was both a combination of pain and nerves. I read A LOT of horror reviews online before that appointment. Word to the wise: Don't psyche yourself out for an experience that could be drastically different from someone else's. 

For a few hours post insertion, I experienced a couple dizzy spells, and for the past 36 hours I've been spotting and cramping mildly. Would I do it again? I'll update at the three-month mark to tell you how it's going!”",3

Thankfully my best friend was with me and was able to talk me through it and drive my ass around for the day. The after cramps weren't unbearable, but still very uncomfortable. I only spotted for a few days afterwards. Last week was a breeze. I had no problems at all. Last night I started feeling cramping, like I was dreaming and could feel them in my dreams. I woke up this morning and the cramps were super intense. I got to work and too about 1,000 mg of ibuprofen because they were bad.”",4

The draw backs are that my partner can feel the strings and he says they stick him and since I have stopped bleeding I have had symptoms of pregnancy. I guess its my body reacting to no period.

So the first month with Mirena was really painful. Uterine cramps at every end of the day and some spotting. From the first month I completely lost my period. I also completely lost my libido, which has never been so strong as I had always took hormones as birth control (previously on pills) 

For the past 2 years I had mild acne like 3-4 pimples every month. But with Mirena, my face was covered with it. Mostly around my mouth and on my forehead (but then it spread to my cheeks) I lost all my self confidence. I removed mirena after 6 months and my doctor gave me minocycline 500mg 2x a day + topical/acid cream. 

I am now on IUD Mona Lisa (copper IUD) and I didn't have a single cramp after its insertion + my libido has never been this strong

I am a 29-year old mother of one.  Prior to having a child, I had been on many versions of the pill, with no issues.  A year after my son was born, I tried the mini-pill, along with other lower-dose versions of the pill, but found that I was moody and wanting to crawl out of my skin most of the time.  My doctor had recommended Mirena, as it contains a very small amount of a progestin hormone. 

Insertion was mildly uncomfortable, but tolerable; Some cramping continued for the next 24 hours, but nothing worse than what I had experienced during periods.  I have noticed an increase in hair loss while in the shower, but nothing abnormal; I'm not going bald.  I would occasionally notice my breasts were tender, but typically around the time of menstruation. I have had zero issues with weight gain or mood swings, and found no issues with my libido.  It has been five months and I have stopped getting my period, as of this month.  Hurray!  

I've always had very heavy periods, but they became much lighter almost immediately.  The most irritating part was spotting for days before and after my actual period.

The reason I chose to remove it, is that the last 6 months or so, I had much more spotting, I thought my periods would go away, but they never did, and it became highly unpredictable. I am hoping that if I have to have a period, I'd like to know when it is, even if it's heavier.

It does hurt to get in, a lot of cramping and pinching, but it only last for a few moments and is totally worth it in my book. I had it inserted towards the end of my period. Yesterday( the second day I had it) my bleeding stopped by the end of the day and I had no cramping. Today so far no spotting, although that wouldn't worry me, and ive also had no cramping or pain of any kind anywhere. So far I love it. My boyfriend and I had unprotected sex last night and it was wonderful not to have to think about taking  a pill or worrying if it was not effective yet. I would highly recommend so far. i will post again in about a month.”",3

The doctor told me I will experience slight discomfort for the first three weeks and that my bleeding may be abnormal-but what I experienced was far beyond that. The pain on ONLY my right side started to become more severe and COMPLETELY random, it woke me up at nights. I thought it was just my body getting used to the foreign device in my body, after all the doc did say it would take some time. I gave it 4 months of daily agonizing pain and many doc appointments just making sure the Mirena was in place and nothing was wrong. The doc kept me assured that everything was in place and basically hinted that I was simply being dramatic. IUD's aren't worth it to me, I'm back to pills. Too scary!”",3

So I waited for about 3 months and it did go away - no more heavy bleeding I hardly get a period and no bad cramps. I did gain a little more weight and I do get headache sometimes but not often.

kell,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"March 20, 2018",1,0,"		“I got the Mirena IUD for free at age 26 as a member of the test group when it was still being tested at Johns Hopkins. I had it for almost 4 years, I had it removed because it had slipped down some and I GOT PREGNANT. When it was removed it initiated a painful miscarriage that ended in a surgery. I ALSO had multiple ovarian cysts throughout the time I had it that kept coming for the next 8 or so years including a painful cyst the size of a baseball that had to be removed in emergency surgery. When I began to try to get pregnant about 2 years after having it removed I couldn't and never did again. I was diagnosed me with unexplained infertility but the obgyn did suggest that my issues were probably due to all the complications I had from the Mirena.. 
I can't stress this enough to women out there considering this type of IUD, USE ANOTHER FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL!! The risks with using this IUD are not worth the benefits in my opinion.”",2

When I first got Mirena inserted, I bled for 3-4 weeks straight. My periods are now irregular and I can never plan anything around it because it comes unexpectedly and lasts for 1 week. After my period, I begin spotting for another 1-2 weeks. Light bleeding, nothing heavy, but enough bleeding to affect my sex life. The spotting is CONSTANT and I only get a few days of relief a month. 1-2 weeks of spotting, 1 week of light bleeding, a couple days to MAYBE week of nothing (if I'm lucky), which is the only time I'm able to have sex. And worse, sex seems to trigger more bleeding so I can only have intercourse like one time a month before the cycle starts again. I'm approaching the 1 year mark and I'm so frustrated! I thought it'd be better after 9 months but it's not. I'll stick it out for another 6 months or so, but if this keeps up, I'll just switch to pills.

Given, I don’t have the highest pain tolerance, but I was truly in a lot of pain for about a month after. Getting the IUD put in was so painful for me.

I had promised myself I would *stick it out* and see if anything got better with the side effects but they just kept getting worse.

I did just have it removed because I felt like I was fatigued and I gained 20 lbs while on Mirena.  It could be other things that caused these symptoms but since they started after I went on the birth control I chose to blame the birth control.

I had it removed 4/26/10 and the removal was simple and pain free.  I started to bleed two days later and it has been an inconsistent type of period.  It has been easy so far and I feel good about doing it.

They stopped 4 months after Mirena was implanted and I can't express enough how much I love it! I'll admit, I've never been pregnant so it HURT when the doctor put it in, but that pain lasted a minute at most so it was completely worth it. I recommend it to every lady. It is the most effective form of birth control, you don't have to worry about taking a pill every day or getting a shot every 3 months. I'd get it even if I wasn't sexually active. Best of all, I got it for free at Planned Parenthood! If you don't think you can afford it or if your insurance doesn't cover it, get an appointment with Planned Parenthood and see how they can help. It is great.”",3

I had suffered from some  vaginal ph imbalance prior to my pregnancy. During my pregnancy the pH imbalance and 3/4 months after giving birth it was gone! But as soon as I started using the Mirena, BV started taking over my life. The method was effective for birth control but also I was not having much sex due to the constant BV. I would treat it and it would come right back within a few days! I tried several different treatments but then I finally found other reviews from women with the same horrible issues. It’s something about the string that created the bacteria and creates a biofilm. So Mirena is not a good method for women who have sensitive pH systems.”",1

Jan 2016, I was on my period, I went to change my tampon and felt that something was still hanging out of me. Hesitantly, I took it out &amp; it was my IUD. Now waiting on my appt, but will not trust again. Didn't get pregnant though!”",1
UnpleasedUser1234,NA,"April 6, 2017",5,0,"		“Other than being effective in preventing pregnancy, the side effects I experienced with the Mirena were not enjoyable. I really liked the idea that it was a local hormone as opposed to a systemic hormone (only puts the hormones into your reproductive organs instead of throughout the entire body which is what the pill did), and the convenience of not having to take a pill every day was the biggest positive! However, due to the hormones being local, I noticed the positive benefits I experience with the pill such as not getting acne, came back. My skin got really bad. Also, I ended up getting my period more frequently, for longer periods, as well as had spotting in between periods for the entire 2 years of having my IUD I got it removed.”",1

I am using this form of bc to prevent a 3rd pregnancy, at least until we are ready to make the decision. Being on the pill, it was too hard for me to remember to take it everyday.

Six weeks after I had the coil inserted I began to have upper back pain, muscle tension which got increasingly worse.  I was getting by by popping pain killers and attending physio, nothing helped.

I have been on the Mirena for 3 months now. I went on it to stop my period as I work away and the facilities at camp are bad.
The insertion was extremely painful, I was told to take 2 panadol before to ease the pain.
 Although extremely painful in my opinion it only lasted maybe 1-2 minutes and was over.
Since then I got some mild spotting for about 2 days for which I used a panty liner.
I have not experienced any weight gain or skin issues.
I have not had my period since and I am very happy with the results.

I had my device inserted a fortnight ago, insertion wasn’t incredibly pleasant once they got to inserting but thankfully only lasts a few minutes (much less painful than having a baby come out there lol)
a little crampy the following minutes and felt I was going to bleed. Had a small amount of bleeding for that day/ night and from the next day had nothing. I’ve had no spotting, no real cramping little here and there. Was a little sore and bloated the following 24-48 hours but slowly went down.
Highly recommended taking and pain relief you’re allowed before getting it done.
But so far no issues with skin or hunger or hormones or any of the horror stories I’d read online. I have a follow up appointment in a few weeks to make sure it’s still in the correct spot, but no issues at all so far.

Dreamer35,NA,"May 15, 2011",NA,0,"		“I decided to get the Mirena birth control method because of the legth of protection. I have two children and have had two ectopic pregnancies. My OB recommended Mirena after my last ectopic, exactly 3 weeks ago. I had my left tube removed through a surgery due to this issue. I've read so many comments and really feel a bit nervous about the decision I made. I've had the Mirena now for 2 weeks and so far do not feel any bad symptoms other than light headaches, spotting and cramping that comes and goes. I have lost weight as well. I am really not certain if this symptoms are being caused by the Mirena or by the surgery I had because similar side effects are to be expected from it as well. I am really anxious to see how my Mirena works!”",0
Mamaof2,NA,"July 22, 2021",5,0,"		“I did not have a good experience with Mirena. I had it inserted at 9 weeks postpartum and the following week started bleeding. I had a 3 week long heavy period followed by 2 more weeks of lighter bleeding. After 5 weeks of continuous bleeding and cramping I decided to have it removed. It was important to me to not bleed for several months even if it meant the possibility of no bleeding after a year. I did not like the idea of not having control over my body and not knowing where in my cycle I was at. As I read more into the potential risks I was even more convinced that the IUD was not for me. Although my experience did not end well, I am glad I tried it and would not discourage others to give it a try. Everyone’s body is different. Thankfully the insertion and removal were painless for me because of having just given birth and having an excellent OBGYN. Good luck with your birth control decision ladies!”",0

Yaiden,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"September 29, 2021",10,0,"		“Insertion was like taking a hole puncher to the uterus. It is, intense. Not looking forward to getting the device removed. 
Was bed ridden for 2-3 days with pain, and the first week was so full of pain that I'd felt as though I'd reached a sort of Nirvana. Really I was just in too much pain to think straight. 

Spotted every day for the first 4 months, and my periods were heavier, longer, and the 4th month I got two heavy periods that both lasted 10 days. 

Finally normalizing now that I'm in the 6th month, still seeing spotting before and after my periods, and I'm experiencing more cramping that is also more painful than before I had an IUD. 

Partner can't feel the device, and my strings are so short that I can't feel them either when I do my monthly checks.
Had a check up 3 months in, and everything is properly in position. 
Definitely don't recommend this if you can't handle pain. This has been a struggle to adjust to. 
Take b/c pills if you can instead.”",0

I gave Mirena a fair shot by having it for over a year and a half. Although it does prevent pregnancy, the bleeding is a huge downfall for me.
